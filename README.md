- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dharma Raj Thanait
I have  completed my  BSc.(Hons) Computer  Science  from the  University of  Wolverhampton. 
I  have  worked  on  both  individual  and  group  projects. I love to do challenging tasks. 
Although I have not worked in any organization, I am a quick learner and ready to take new challenges to give better performance.
